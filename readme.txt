The following is a basic implementation of a convolutional neural network using keras and tensorflow on the CIFAR10 dataset. It involved two convolution layers, two max pooling layers of pool size (2,2) as well as two dense layers with activations of relu and softmax respectively. This was done as a part of the NPTEL course on Practical machine learning with tensorflow and achieved an accuracy of 75%.
